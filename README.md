# DSALocationAnalyzer
A program that uses the coordinates of real addresses to create a graph that can be manipulated with an MST and Clustering Algorithm, then displayed using MatPlotLib.

## How it Works
Location Analyzer is a program that takes as input a graph that represents a variety of locations. Using Python and MatPlotLib, the geospatial graph and its connections are displayed on a map. The user then can run either a clustering algorithm or a Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm on the graph, highlighting trends in the relationship between locations.

## Other Information
Originally, this program used data from my school's directory to create a graph of every student's address at my school. Due to privacy reasons, this data has been omitted. Instead, you can find a test file of random locations from Austin, TX.
